# Lifeline AI - Emergency Conversational Assistant

## Project Overview
Lifeline AI is an AI-powered conversational emergency assistant designed to guide users through critical situations using real-time voice responses and step-by-step instructions. The application prioritizes accessibility, calm user experience, and voice-first interaction for people in high-stress emergency scenarios.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Everyday people experiencing medical emergencies (someone fainted, choking, not breathing, seizures)
- **Secondary**: Caregivers, family members, bystanders who need immediate guidance
- **Accessibility Focus**: Users with disabilities, elderly users, people with limited dexterity during stress

## Core Features

### 1. Conversational Interface
- **Chat-based interaction** with AI emergency assistant
- **Voice-first design** with speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **Quick response buttons** for limited dexterity situations
- **Real-time emergency timer** showing elapsed time
- **Message urgency coding** (Critical=Red, High=Orange, Medium=Blue, Low=Green)

### 2. Emergency Response System
- **Intelligent triage** based on user input
- **Step-by-step medical guidance** for common emergencies
- **Direct 911 calling** integration
- **Persistent emergency context** throughout session
- **Medically reviewed protocols** for CPR, choking, unconsciousness

### 3. Accessibility Features
- **Comprehensive accessibility panel** with:
  - Font size control (14px-28px)
  - High contrast mode for low vision
  - Reduced motion for vestibular disorders
  - Large touch targets for motor difficulties
  - Voice-first mode prioritization
- **Screen reader optimization** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** support
- **Touch-friendly design** for stressed/shaking hands

### 4. Multi-language Support
- **10+ languages** with native voice synthesis
- **Voice preview** for each language
- **Cultural adaptation** of emergency protocols
- **RTL language support** for Arabic/Hebrew

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** component library
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Styling Philosophy
- **Medical-grade color scheme**: Blue/white/light grey for trust and calm
- **Large touch targets**: Minimum 44px, preferred 60px+ for emergency use
- **High contrast ratios**: 7:1 for critical text, 4.5:1 minimum
- **Rounded corners**: Soft, approachable design to reduce anxiety
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first with desktop optimization

## User Experience Research

### Emergency Interface Design Principles
1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Simple decisions, clear visual hierarchy
2. **Motor Accessibility**: Large buttons for shaking/stressed hands
3. **Visual Accessibility**: High contrast, large fonts, clear icons
4. **Voice-First Design**: Audio primary, visual secondary
5. **Error Recovery**: Clear states, easy restart options
6. **Emotional Design**: Calming colors, reassuring language

### Accessibility Compliance
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance target
- **Section 508** compatibility
- **ADA** accessibility standards
- **Emergency-specific** accessibility considerations

## Future Integrations

### Planned APIs
- **Murf AI**: Natural voice synthesis in multiple languages
- **Web Speech API**: Real-time speech recognition
- **Geolocation API**: Emergency services routing
- **Emergency Services APIs**: Direct dispatch integration

### Advanced Features
- **Offline mode** with service worker
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities
- **Push notifications** for emergency updates
- **Analytics dashboard** for response effectiveness
- **Medical protocol database** with regular updates

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code formatting
- **Semantic HTML** for screen readers
- **ARIA labels** for all interactive elements
- **Error boundaries** for graceful failures

### Performance Requirements
- **< 3 second** initial load time
- **< 1 second** message response time
- **Offline functionality** for core features
- **Low bandwidth** optimization
- **Battery efficiency** for mobile devices

### Testing Strategy
- **Accessibility testing** with screen readers
- **Emergency scenario** user testing
- **Cross-browser compatibility** testing
- **Mobile device** testing across form factors
- **Stress testing** under high-load conditions

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel** hosting platform
- **Edge functions** for low latency
- **CDN optimization** for global reach
- **Environment variables** for API keys
- **Monitoring** with error tracking

## Security & Privacy
- **No personal data storage** beyond session
- **HIPAA considerations** for medical guidance
- **End-to-end encryption** for voice data
- **Privacy-first design** with minimal tracking
- **Secure API** communications

## Business Context
Lifeline AI addresses the critical gap in immediate emergency response when professional help is minutes away. The application serves as a bridge between emergency occurrence and professional medical intervention, potentially saving lives through proper guidance and emotional support.

The focus on accessibility ensures the application serves all users, including those with disabilities who may face additional challenges during emergencies. The conversational approach reduces cognitive load compared to traditional step-by-step instruction apps.
